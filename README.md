You've got Key-Values! A Redis Jump Start
===========

Want to bring more performance, speed, and scalability to your website? Or scale your sites for real-time services or message passing? Learn how, and get practical real-world tips in this exploration of [Redis](http://redis.io/), part of a series on choosing the right data storage. 

[Steven Edouard](https://twitter.com/sedouard) and [I](https://twitter.com/ramisayar) show you how to get up and running with Redis, a powerful key-value cache and store. In this course, you can check out a number of practical and advanced use cases for Redis as cache, queue, and publish/subscribe (pub/sub) tool, look at NoSQL and data structures, see how to create list sets and sorted sets in the cache, and much more.

You can watch the course online on [Microsoft Virtual Academy](http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/liveevents/you-ve-got-key-values-a-redis-jump-start).

This is the companion code repository for the course where you will find all the code samples and presentations. 

## [Module 1: Introduction to Key-Value Databases]()

This is the introductory module covering the basics of key-value stores vs tabular databases. In this module you'll understand the fundamental organization of key-value stores, the concept of caches and other data structures. 

## [Module 2: Getting Started with Redis]()

In this module, we will cover installing and setting up Redis on Windows, learning the basic commands of Redis and general data structures. 

## [Module 3: Advanced Data Structures with Redis]()

In this module, we will learn about sets, sorted sets, hashes and hyperloglogs.

## [Module 4: Getting Started with Redis Cache]()

In this module, we will learn about Azure Redis Cache, how to set it up on the new Azure Portal and how to connect to it.

## [Module 5: Redis via C#, Python & Node.js]()

In this module, we will learn how to connect to Azure Redis Cache with C#, Python & Node.js and see how we can use Redis as a cache in a variety of applications.

## [Module 6: Redis as a Pub/Sub on Azure VM]()

In this module, we will show you how to use Redis as a publish-subscribe mechanism. This is one of Redis' more interesting applications and we will show you how to set up Redis as a pub-sub on Azure VMs.
